Distributed Graph Algorithms in DistAlgo
----------------------------------------
This repository contains the implementations of a some _distributed_ graph algorithms as well as two token-based mutex algorithms in ***DistAlgo***. DistAlgo is a superset of Python that adds special constructs to Python for specifying distributed algorithms in a high-level and succint manner. The DistAlgo program files end with extension *.dis and get compiled to portable Python 3 programs. DistAlgo was developed at [Stony Brook University](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/) by [Annie Liu](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~liu/) and her PhD students Bo Lin, Jon Brandvein, etc.

The distributed algorithms that have been implemented are:
* [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree)
* [Maximal Independent Set](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/Maximal-Independent-Set)
* [Breadth First Search](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/Breadth-First-Search)
* [Single-pair Shortest Path](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/ShortestPath)
* Ricart-Agrawala's and Suzuki-Kasami's token-based [distributed mutex algorithms](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/DistributedMutex)

Each link contains a relevant ***ReadMe*** file that describes the particular algorithm in detail with specific information about its implementation, limitations, etc.
