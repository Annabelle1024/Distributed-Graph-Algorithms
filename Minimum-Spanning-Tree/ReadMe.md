Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree
=================================
This program implements the distributed MST algorithm by R. G. Gallager, P. A. Humblet and P. M. Spira.

A paper describing the algorithm prepared by Guy Flysher and Amir Rubinshtein can be found  [here](https://github.com/arjungmenon/DistAlgo/raw/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/MST.pdf).
