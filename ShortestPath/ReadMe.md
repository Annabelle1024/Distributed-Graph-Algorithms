#### Problem Description

The [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) as we all know is the quest to find the shortest path between two nodes in a connected weighted undirected graph.

### Algorithm

As the problem was rather simple, so I opted to design my own algorithm for it.

#### Steps involved in the algorithm
