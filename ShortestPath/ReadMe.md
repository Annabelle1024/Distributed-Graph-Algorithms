Shortest Path
-------------

#### Problem Description

The [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) as we all know is the quest to find the shortest path between two nodes in a connected weighted undirected graph.

### Algorithm

The problem was pretty straighforward and simple, so I didn't see a need to research it online. So I designed my own algorithm for it. The algorithm is described in the next section.

#### Steps involved in the algorithm
