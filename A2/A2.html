<p><b>Programming exercises</b>

</p><p>This assignment is for practicing programming of concurrent and
distributed algorithms, by implementing a few algorithms discussed in
class using Python and DistAlgo, a Python extension for programming
distributed algorithms.


</p><p><b>Programming concurrent algorithms</b>

</p><p>The task for this part is to implement two algorithms for
shared-memory mutual exclusion, (1) Lamport's fast mutual exclusion
algorithm and (2) Lamport's bakery algorithm, using Python.

</p><p>These algorithms were discussed in class in Week 2, and pseudocode
for them are posted under Lectures on the interactive site.

</p><p>You need also write a driver program for testing the correctness
and performance of your implementation of the algorithms.

</p><p>Your driver program should take a given number of threads, and a
given total number of requests randomly distributed among the threads,
and run the two algorithms (1) and (2) in turn; it should print out
"Running Lamport's fast mutual exclusion algorithm" or "Running
Lamport's bakery algorithm", when starting the respective algorithms,
and print out "P requesting CS", "P entering CS", and "P exiting CS"
at each request of CS, each entrance of CS, and each exit of CS,
respectively, by a thread P.

</p><p>Additionally, to facilitate testing of your programs using our
driver code, you must define thread classes "Fast" and "Bakery" for
algorithms (1) and (2), respectively; the classes must provide a
method "cs" that takes a method object "task" and calls "task" in the
critical section; you must also provide a top-level method "setup"
that takes the set of all thread objects and the total number of
requests and initializes shared variables used by the algorithm.

</p><p>Your program must run under Python 3.2.  Your main program must be
named <code>main.py</code>, and must run with a command like the
following, where n is the umber of threads, and m is the total number
of requests, and print the desired output.
</p><pre>python.exe main.py n m
</pre>

<p>Your handin must include a <code>README.txt</code> file that
includes explanations and credits as well as your identification
(reminder: follow the requirements on the course page).  Please also
include your test data and anything else you have to show your work.

</p><p>Clarity of your program is the most important, because it helps
ensure program correctness, especially for such nontrivial algorithms
we study.  As much as possible, your program should be at a high level
of abstraction like pseudo-code is.  In particular, it should use set
queries and quantifications (comprehensions and generator expressions
in Python), not loops, when possible.


</p><p><b>Programming distributed algorithms</b>

</p><p>The task for this part is to implement two algorithms for
distributed mutual exclusion, (1) Ricart-Agrawala's token-based
algorithm and (2) Suzuki-Kasami's token-based algorithm, using
DistAlgo.

</p><p>These algorithms were discussed in class in Week 3, and pseudocode
for them are posted under Lectures on the interactive site.

</p><p>The requirements are the same as those above for programming the
two concurrent algorithms, except for the following:
</p><ol>
<li> Mentions of "thread" are replaced with "process".
</li><li> Your program should print out "Running Ricart-Agrawala's
token-based algorithm for distributed mutex" and "Running
Suzuki-Kasami's token-based algorithm for distributed mutex", when
starting the respective algorithms.
</li><li> The two process classes should be named "RAtoken" and "SKtoken".
</li><li> Instead of a top-level method "setup", the two process classes
must provide a method "setup" that takes the set of other processes
and the total number of requests.
</li></ol>

<p>Follow <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~liu/csex9x/DistAlgo-0.1.zip">this link</a> to obtain DistAlgo.
To get you started, follow <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~liu/csex9x/lamport.dis">this link</a> to obtain
Lamport's 3n message algorithm in DistAlgo,
and <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~liu/csex9x/mutex2n.dis">this link</a> to obtain Ricart-Agrawala's 2n
message algorithm in DistAlgo.

<!--
<p>Instructions for running your program will be posted here tomorrow.
The requirements will be similar to those above for programming the
two concurrent algorithms.
-->

<!--<p><b>Additional requirements</b>-->

</p><p><b>Things to think about</b>

</p><p>Did I program the algorithms in the clearest way I can possibly do?

<br>Does my driver code follow the requirements exactly, so my code
can run with the desired input and output exactly as described?

<br>Did I write a complete and clear README file?

<br>How would I compare programming in Python and DistAlgo with
programming in C, Java, and other languages I already know?

</p>

<p><b>Grading</b> 

</p><p>There are a total of 100 points, distributed as follows, adjusted by
the clarity of your programs and your <code>README.txt</code> file.
Hard-to-understand code can loose up to 30 points.
<code>README.txt</code> file missing appropriate identifications,
explanations, or credits can loose up to 30 points.
</p><pre> 50: program for the two shared-memory mutex algorithms
     20: code for each algorithm
     10: organization of the rest of the code
     <b>Tips:</b> 
     Put your code for each algorithm in a different module.
     Make your code for each algorithm correspond exactly to the pseudocode.
     The only difference between your code for the two algorithms
     should be the methods cs and setup, besides names of the two algorithms.
 50: the two distributed mutex algorithms
     same details as for the two shared-memory algorithms above
