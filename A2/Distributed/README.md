Assignment 2 Part II
--------------------
This is an implementation of Ricart-Agrawala's token-based algorithm and Suzuki-Kasami's token-based algorithm, using DistAlgo.

`RAtoken.dis` contains Ricart-Agrawala's algorithm.

`SKtoken.dis` contains Suzuki-Kasami's algorithm.

For Ricart-Agarwala's algorithm, I followed the pseudocode which can be found as a top-level comment in `RAtoken.dis`

For Suzuki-Kasami's algorithm, I followed [a description of the algorithm by Mikhail Nesterenko](http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/aos.f01/l17tokenDMX.pdf) of Kent State.

You can ignore `lamport.dis` `mutex2n.dis` and `main.dis`
